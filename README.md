> Steps for running the code of the LSTM Model
1) Open the Google Colab link: [LSTM Google Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SYQufuY71rBbWgLw56ykVJkEpUj8P5kb)
2) Download the dataset given in our github repository and upload it on this Google Colab(as shared above).
3) Start the code running sequentially but when you reached the code

   <br> and <br>

   <br>
   You will get an error.
4) To overcome this error, please run code sequentially starting from this code snippet ![image](https://github.com/ShreyasHonrao/Computational-Intelligence-Project/assets/99578509/5be0204a-7674-46ce-845a-2212ceacc950)
5) After running the entire model, you will get the following results:
   a) Overlaid graph of actual and predicated values of the stock
   b) Our performance parameter root mean square error(RMSE)
   c) Overlaid graph of actual and predicated Returns on daily basis of the stock
